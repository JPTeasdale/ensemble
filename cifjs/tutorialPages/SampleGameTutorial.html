Today we will be making a simple, sample game using CiF!

To start with, you'll be wanting to make a new file. We'll call it ourFunGame.html. You'll want to fill it up with your typical html friends, the html tag, the body tag, the title tag, you know the drill.

The big important thing that you add is the following line:

<pre><script src="cif.js"></script></pre>

And that should get you access to all of the wonders of CiF.

You can also include the following line:

<pre>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function()) {
	var loadResult = cif.init();
	console.log(loadResult);
	}
}
</pre>

This will make sure that the page does not start up until all of cif has been successfully loaded. You should see a little true appear on your javascript console if cif was loaded successfully.
