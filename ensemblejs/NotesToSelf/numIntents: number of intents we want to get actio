numIntents: number of intents we want to get actions from. IF 1, it means we only want it from the highest rated volition, if two, then from the 2 most highest rated volitions, etc.

numActionsPerIntent: The number of actions that should come FROM a particular intent. A potential point of confusion is that, based on how the structure of the actionList is set up, is this referring to multiple terminals from the same action (e.g. bondTerminal1, bondTerminal2), or should it only be looking at things from 'different branches (e.g. bondTerminal1, laughTerminal1'

numActionsPerGroup: the number of terminals that come from a single branch (i.e. if 1, we'll only ever get bondTerminal1, laughTerminal1, etc. If 2, we could go up to bondTerminal2, laughTerminal2, etc.)

How do we expect these three numbers to influence each other?

So, let's say that numIntents is 1 for now. So, we're just dealing with 'friendsUp.'

If numActionsPerIntent is 1...
---Regardless of what numActionsPerGroup is, it should return the single, 'best' terminal.

if numActionsPerIntent is 2...
---If numActionsPerGroup is 1...
-----It should return the best terminal from ONE branch of the intent, and another terminal from another branch of the intent (e.g. bondTerminal 1, laughTerminal1) This... I think... should mostly be covered for us when we 'get' the action list.
---If numActionsPerGroup is 2...
-----It should... 
	(I think this is the rub, I can see it doing 1 of two things...)
	1.) Return the two best terminals, period (even if they come from the same branch)
	2.) Return the best terminal from 1 branch, and the other best terminal from another branch.
	I'm kind of leaning towards number 1, because otherwise, I don't think there would ever be a point to specifying numActionsPerGroup to be greater than 1 (which, frankly, maybe isn't a bad thing?)

if numActionsPerIntent is 3...
---I think it should do the same as the above, which frankly does the exact same thing regardless of what the value of numActionsPerGroupIs.
---ActionList provides the 'top candidates' for an Intent (maybe they are from the same branch, maybe they are from multiple branches)
---It's the responsibility of this function to find the 'N best' terminals from this list (where N is numActionsPerIntent)
---And then, armed with this, we sort them and... just have a big list of them? Store them 'by intent' and return that?
-----Maybe for simplicities sake at first, let's just store them in a big list. We can store them 'by intent' later on if we find it useful (which we probably will).

Ok, so I think the above is all well and good... but what if numIntents is MORE than 1?

I thinkt the thing that is hanging me up is if we want it to be 'sorted' by intent at all, so, like, fo we want the data structure to look like this:

StartDating
	askoutTerminal1
	flirtTerminal1
	flirtTerminal2
StartFriends
	laughTerminal1
	bondTerminal1

Or do we want it to look like this:

askoutTerminal1
flirtTerminal1
flirtTerminal2
laughTerminal1
bondTerminal1

Yup, I think that, right there, is the crux of my confusion. And you know what? I think my life would be a lot easier if it was the second one for now. So, that's what I'm going to do. We can make it different/better as we actually see some intersting use cases crop up. So let's go for this for now.
