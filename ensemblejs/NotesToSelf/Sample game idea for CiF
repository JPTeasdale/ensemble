Sample game idea for CiF

Ascii art.

YOU ------------------- LOVER ------ RIVAL

You want to close the distance between you and lover
You want to extend difference between lover and rival (you lose if lover and rival get close together)
---Techically this is the same number; as one increases the other one implicitly decreases, and vice versa.

MAYBE: all games are just between you and lover (for simplicity)

recipricol network value: distance?

You win when you minimize distance? Or that unlocks the action "kiss" or whatever.
--Kiss only is an option if you are close
--Only succeeds if romance is high.

There are actions you can take which don't involve a second person (study! Workout! etc.!)
--These increase your individual stats, make you more likely to succeed.
--Through TRIGGER RULES -- makes your lover walk away from you (you are not paying attention to them enough, so sad!)
----i.e. trigger rule -- if there is no SFDBLabel with a time of 1 of 'paidAttentionToGirl' then decrease distance from hero and boy by X.

This seems super simple, and maybe even kind of fun!

Idea: you have super high volition for romance, but if distance is too great, lover will shy away!
--Have to ease into it. Fight your instincts! Take it slow!
--But if you take it too slow, rival moves in? 
---Shows that you can adjust CiF values outside of actions! Can just do it from gameplay purposes!

Style the buttons differently based on their intent. (just to show how to get that information)
--If it is even possible to get that information.
